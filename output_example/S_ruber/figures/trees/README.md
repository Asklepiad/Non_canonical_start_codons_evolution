This folder contains figures that are obtained as a result of the pipeline and show various **descriptive statistics**: 
* the percentage of genes with different start codons
* the distribution of genes with different start codons according to different COG categories
* U-curve (shows how many assemblies in a given organism how many orthologous rows with such start codons are contained).
